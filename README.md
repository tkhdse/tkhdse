## Hi there 👋 I'm Tanish!

💡 Software Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm a passionate engineer focused on building robust, high-performance systems from the metal up through the cloud. My interests lie at the intersection of extreme scalability, low-latency machine learning, and foundational systems engineering.

### 🔥 Core Expertise & Interests
I enjoy building systems that demand exceptional speed and resilience:
- Low-Latency ML Systems: Designing and optimizing production machine learning pipelines where every millisecond counts, leveraging technologies like CUDA, PyTorch, and high-speed memory architectures.
- Highly Scalable Cloud & Distributed Systems: Architecting resilient, geo-distributed services on major cloud platforms (GCP & AWS), utilizing Kubernetes, Docker, and event-driven architectures for massive throughput.
- Deep Systems Engineering: Fascinated by the fundamental layers of computing, I have hands-on experience and deep interest in Compiler/OS internals, systems programming (Rust & C/C++), and kernel-level optimizations.


### 🌱 Let's Connect!

I am always open to discussing new challenges. If you are looking for an engineer with a strong foundation in systems and a drive for high performance, please feel free to reach out!
